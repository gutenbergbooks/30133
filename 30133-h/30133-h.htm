<h3>FOLK LORE IN THE REIGN OF KING JAMES I.</h3>

  <p>In turning over the pages of an old book of controversial divinity, I
  stumbled upon the following illustrations of folk lore; which, as well
  from their antiquity as from their intrinsic curiosity, seem worthy of a
  place in your columns. They make us acquainted with some of the usages of
  our ancestors, who lived in the remoter districts of England early in the
  reign of James I. The title of the volume in which they occur is the
  following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Way to the True Church; wherein the principall Motives persuading
  to Romanisme, and Questions touching the Nature and Authoritie of the
  Church and Scriptures, are familiarly disputed ... directed to all that
  seeks for Resolution; and especially to all his loving Countrymen of
  Lancashire, by John White, Minister of God's Word at Eccles. Folio.
  London, 1624."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This, however, is described as being "the fifth impression;" the
  Preface is dated Oct. 29, 1608; so that we arrive at the conclusion that
  the usages and rhymes, to which I now desire to invite the attention of
  your readers, were current in the north-west districts of England more
  than two hundred and fifty years since.</p>

  <p>White is insisting upon "the prodigious ignorance" which he found
  among his parishioners when he entered upon his ministrations, and he
  proceeds thus to tell his own tale:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I will only mention what I saw and learned, dwelling among them,
  concerning the saying of their prayers; for what man is he whose heart
  trembles not to see simple people so far seduced that they know not how
  to pronounce or say their daily prayers; or so to pray that all that hear
  them shall be filled with laughter? And while, superstitiously, they
  refuse to pray in their own language with understanding, they speak that
  which their leaders may blush to hear. These examples I have observed
  from the common people."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE CREED.</span></p>

  <p>"Creezum zuum patrum onitentem creatorum ejus anicum, Dominum nostrum
  qui sum sops, virgini Mariæ, crixus fixus, Ponchi Pilati audubitiers,
  morti <!-- Page 614 --><span class="pagenum"><a

      <p>That we might all to heaven come.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"This that followeth they call the 'White Pater-noster:'</p>

  <p>"Another Prayer:</p>

  <p>"Many also use to weare vervein against blasts; and when they gather

      <p>And staunchedst his bleeding wound;</p>
      <p>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</p>
      <p>I take thee from the ground."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>These passages may be seen in the "Preface to the Reader," §&nbsp;13., no
  page, but on the reverse of Sig. A&nbsp;4.</p>

  <p>It might at first appear somewhat strange that these interesting
  remnants of early belief should have escaped the notice of your numerous
  correspondents, whose attention has for so long a period been directed to
  this inquiry: but this may be accounted for if we remember that the
  volume in which they occur is one which would seem, <i>primâ facie</i>,
  least likely to afford any such materials. It is one of those uninviting
  bulky folios of which the reigns of James and Charles I. furnish us with
  so many specimens. Here we might fairly expect to discover abundant
  illustrations of patristic and scholastic theology, of learning and
  pedantry, of earnest devotion, and ill-temper no less earnest; but
  nothing whereby to illustrate the manners or customs, the traditions, or
  the popular usages or superstitions, of the common people. This may be a
  hint for us, however, to direct our attention to a class of literature
  which hitherto has scarcely received the attention to which it would
  appear to be entitled; and I would venture to express my conviction, that
  if those who are interested in the illustration of our popular
  antiquities were to give a little of their time to early English
  theology, the result would be more important than might at first be
  anticipated.</p>

<h3>THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The fact mentioned by your correspondent <span class="sc">C. Clifton
  Barry</span>, at p. 357., as to the affinity of Midland songs and ballads
  to those of Scotland, I have often observed, and among the striking
  instances of it which could be adduced, the following may be named, as
  well known in Northamptonshire:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It rains, it rains, in merry Scotland;</p>
      <p>It rains both great and small;</p>
      <p>And all the schoolfellows in merry Scotland</p>
      <p>Must needs go and play at ball.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"They tossed the ball so high, so high,</p>
      <p>And yet it came down so low;</p>
      <p>They tossed it over the old Jew's gates,</p>
      <p>And broke the old Jew's window.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The old Jew's daughter she came out;</p>
      <p>Was clothed all in green;</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Come hither, come hither, thou young Sir Hugh,</p>
      <p>And fetch your ball again.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'I dare not come, I dare not come,</p>
      <p>Unless my schoolfellows come all;</p>
      <p>And I shall be flogged when I get home,</p>
      <p>For losing of my ball.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She 'ticed him with an apple so red,</p>
      <p>And likewise with a fig:</p>
      <p>She laid him on the dresser board,</p>
      <p>And stickéd him like a pig.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The thickest of blood did first come out,</p>
      <p>The second came out so thin;</p>
      <p>The third that came was his dear heart's blood,</p>
      <p>Where all his life lay in."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I write this from memory: it is but a fragment of the whole, which I
  think is printed, with variations, in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>. It is also
  worthy of remark, that there is a resemblance also between the words
  which occur as provincialisms in the same district, and some of those
  which are used in Scotland; e.g. <i>whemble</i> or <i>whommel</i>
  (sometimes not aspirated, and pronounced <i>wemble</i>), to turn upside
  down, as a dish. This word is Scotch, although they do not pronounce the
  b any more than in <i>Campbell</i>, which sounds very much like
  <i>Camel</i>.</p>

<h3>PENNSYLVANIAN FOLK LORE: CHRISTMAS.</h3>

  <p>This anniversary holds the same rank in the middle, southern, and
  western states as Thanksgiving Day in the eastern states or New England,
  where, owing to the Puritan origin of the bulk of the inhabitants,
  Christmas is not much celebrated. In Pennsylvania many of the usages
  connected with it are of German origin, and derived from the early
  settlers of the Teutonic race, whose descendants are now a very numerous
  portion of the population. The Christmas Tree is thus devised: It is
  planted in a flower-pot filled with earth, and its branches are covered
  with presents, chiefly of confectionary, for the younger members of the
  family.</p>

  <p>When bed-time arrives on Christmas Eve, the children hang up their
  stockings at the foot of their beds, to receive presents brought them by
  a fabulous personage called <i>Krishkinkle</i>, who is believed to
  descend the chimney with them for all the children who have been good
  during the previous year. The word <i>Krishkinkle</i> is a corruption of
  <i>Christ-kindlein</i>, literally <i>Christ-infant</i>, and is understood
  to be derived from the fact that a representation of the Infant Saviour
  in the manger formed part of the decorations prepared for the children at
  Christmas.</p>

  <p>If the children have not been good during the year previous, instead
  of finding sugar-plums and other presents in their stockings on Christmas
  morning, they discover therein a birch-rod. This is said to have been
  placed there by <i>Pelsnichol</i>, or Nicholas with the fur, alluding to
  the dress of skins in which he is said to be clad. Some make
  <i>Pelsnichol</i> identical with <i>Krishkinkle</i>, but the more general
  opinion is that they are two personages, one the rewarder of the good,
  the other the punisher of the bad.</p>

  <p>The functions ascribed to Krishkinkle in Pennsylvania are attributed
  to Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus in the State of New York, first settled
  by the Hollanders. The following poem, written by Clement C. Moore,
  LL.D., of New York, describes the performances of St. Nicholas on
  Christmas Eve, and is equally applicable to our Krishkinkle:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"<i>A Visit from St. Nicholas.</i></p>
      <p class="hg1">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house</p>
      <p>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</p>
      <p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</p>
      <p>In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.</p>
      <p>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</p>
      <p>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;</p>
      <p>And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap</p>
      <p>Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,</p>
      <p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</p>
      <p>I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.</p>
      <p>Away to the window I flew like a flash,</p>
      <p>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash;</p>
      <p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow</p>
      <p>Gave the lustre of day to the objects below;</p>
      <p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear</p>
      <p>But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,</p>
      <p>With a little old driver so lively and quick,</p>
      <p>I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.</p>
      <p>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</p>
      <p>And he whistled and shouted and call'd them by name,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer! now,     Vixen!</p>
      <p>On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Dunder and Blixen!</p>
      <p>To the top of the stoop<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, to the top of the wall!</p>
      <p>Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!'</p>
      <p>As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,</p>
      <p>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,</p>
      <p>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,</p>
      <p>With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too;</p>
      <p>And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof</p>
      <p>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</p>
      <p>As I drew in my head and was turning around,</p>
      <p>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</p>
      <p>He was dress'd all in fur from his head to his foot,</p>
      <p>And his clothes were all tarnish'd with ashes and soot.</p>
      <p>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back;</p>
      <p>And he look'd like a pedlar just opening his pack.</p>
      <p>His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!</p>
      <p>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;</p>
      <p>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</p>
      <p>And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;</p>
      <p>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</p>
      <p>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.</p>
      <p>He had a broad face and a little round belly,</p>
      <p>That shook, when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of jelly.</p>
      <p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,</p>
      <p>And I laugh'd when I saw him, in spite of myself.</p>
      <p>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head</p>
      <p>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>
      <p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</p>
      <p>And fill'd all the stockings, then turn'd with a jerk;</p>
      <p>And laying his finger aside of his nose,</p>
      <p>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.</p>
      <p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</p>
      <p>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle:</p>
      <p>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.'"</p>

<h3>LEGENDS OF THE CO. CLARE: FUENVICOUIL (FINGAL)
AND THE GIANT.</h3>

  <p>Once upon a time, a Scottish giant who had heard of Fuenvicouil's
  fame, determined to come and see which of them was the stronger. Now
  Fuenvicouil was informed by his thumb of the giant's intentions, and also
  that on the present occasion matters would not turn out much to his
  advantage if they fought: so as he did not feel the least bit
  "blue-mowlded for the want of a batin'," like Neal Malone, he was at a
  loss what to do. Oonagh, his wife, saw his distress, and soon contrived
  to find out the cause of it; and having done so, she assured him that if
  he would leave things to her management, and strictly obey her
  directions, she would make the giant return home faster than he came.
  Fuenvicouil promised obedience; and, as no time was to be lost, Oonagh
  commenced her preparations. She first baked two or three large cakes of
  bread, taking care to put the griddle (the iron plate used in Ireland and
  Scotland for baking bread on) into the largest. She then put several
  gallons of milk down to boil, and made whey of it; and carefully
  collected the curd into a mass, which she laid aside. She then proceeded
  to dress up Fuenvicouil as a baby; and having put a cap on his head,
  tucked him up in the cradle, charging him on no account to speak, but to
  carefully obey any signs she might make to him. The preparations were
  only just completed, when the giant arrived, and, striding into the
  house, demanded to see Fuenvicouil. Oonagh received him politely; said
  she could not tell <i>any more than the child in the cradle</i>, where
  her husband then was; but requested the giant to sit down and rest, till
  Fuenvicouil came in. She then placed bread and whey before him till some
  better refreshments could be got ready, taking care to give him the cake
  with the griddle in it, and serving the whey in a vessel that held two or
  three gallons. The giant was a little surprised at the <i>quantity</i> of
  the lunch set before him, and proceeded to break a piece off the cake but
  in vain; he then tried to bite it, with as little success: and as to
  swallowing the ocean of whey set before him, it was out of the question;
  so he said he was not hungry, and would wait. He then asked Oonagh what
  was the favourite feat of strength her husband prided himself upon. She
  could not indeed particularise any one, but said that sometimes
  Fuenvicouil amused himself with squeezing water out of that stone there,
  pointing to a rock lying near the door. The giant immediately took it up;
  and squeezed it till the blood started from his fingers, but made no
  impression on the rock. Oonagh laughed at his discomfiture, and said a
  child could do that, handing at the same time the lump of curds to "the
  baby." Fuenvicouil, who had been attentively listening to all that was
  going on, gave the curd a squeeze, and some drops of whey fell from it.
  Oonagh, in apparently great delight, kissed and hugged her "dear baby;"
  and breaking a bit off one of the cakes she had prepared, began to coax
  the "child" to eat a little bit and get strong. The giant amazed, asked,
  could that child eat such hard bread? And Oonagh persuaded him to put his
  finger into the child's mouth, "just to feel his teeth;" and as soon as
  Fuenvicouil got the giant's finger in his mouth, he bit it off. This was
  more than the giant could stand; and seeing that a child in the cradle
  was so strong, he was convinced that the sooner he decamped before
  Fuenvicouil's return the better; so he hastened from the house, while
  Oonagh in vain pressed him to remain; and never stopped till he returned
  to his own place, very happy at having escaped a meeting with
  Fuenvicouil.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE MISCELLANIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Yorkshire Tradition.</i>&mdash;The following tradition of
  Osmotherly, in Yorkshire, was related to me as being current in that
  county. Can you inform me if it is authentic?</p>

  <p>Some years ago there lived in a secluded part of Yorkshire a lady who
  had an only son named Os or Oscar. Strolling one day with her child they
  met a party of gipsies, who were anxious to tell her the child's fortune.
  After being much importuned she assented to their request. To the
  mother's astonishment and grief they prognosticated that the child would
  be drowned. In order to avert so dreadful a calamity, the infatuated
  mother purchased some land and built a house on the summit of a high
  hill, where she lived with her son a long time in peace and seclusion.
  Happening one fine summer's day in the course of a perambulation to have
  fatigued themselves, they sat down on the grass to rest and soon fell
  asleep. While enjoying this repose, a spring rose up from the ground,
  which caused such an inundation as to overwhelm them, and side by side
  they found a watery grave. After this had occurred, the people residing
  in the neighbourhood named it Os-by-his-mother-lay, which has since been
  corrupted into Osmotherly.</p>

  <p><i>Custom on St. Thomas's Day</i> (<i>Dec. 21</i>).&mdash;At
  Harvington, in Worcestershire, it is the custom on St. Thomas's Day for
  persons (chiefly children) to go round the village begging for apples,
  and singing the following rhymes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wissal, wassail through the town,</p>
      <p>If you've got any apples, throw them down.</p>
      <p>Up with the stocking, and down with the shoe,</p>
      <p>If you've got no apples, money will do.</p>
      <p>The jug is white, and the ale is brown,</p>
      <p>This is the best house in the town."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, B.A.</p>

  <p><i>Custom on Innocents' Day</i> (<i>Dec. 28</i>).&mdash;At Norton
  (near Evesham) it is the custom on Dec. 28 to ring, first a muffled peal
  for the slaughter of the Holy Innocents, and then an unmuffled peal of
  joy for the deliverance of the Infant Christ.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, B.A.</p>

  <p><i>Marriage Custom at Knutsford, Cheshire.</i>&mdash;A singular but
  pleasing custom exists among the inhabitants of Knutsford in Cheshire. On
  the occasion of a wedding, when the bride has set out for the church, a
  relative invariably spreads on the pavement, which is composed of
  pebbles, before her house, a quantity of silver sand, there called
  "greet," in the form of wreaths of flowers, and writes, with the same
  material, wishes for her happiness. This, of course, is soon discovered
  by others, and immediately, especially if the bride or bridegroom are
  favorites, appear before most of the houses numerous flowers in sand. It
  is said that this custom arose from the only church they had being
  without bells, and therefore, to give notice of a wedding, they adopted
  it; and though now there are other churches and a peal of bells, they
  still adhere to the above method of communicating intelligence of such
  happy events. Why sand should be used I have not been able to learn, and
  I should be much obliged for any information on the point, there being no
  sandpits in the locality of Knutsford, or such like reason for its
  use.</p>

  <p>One circumstance I may mention connected with weddings there. On the
  return of the party from church, it is usual to throw money to the boys,
  who, of course, follow, and if this is omitted, the latter keep up a cry
  of "a buttermilk wedding."</p>

  <p><i>Folk Lore in Hampshire.</i>&mdash;In Hampshire the country people
  believe that a healing power exists in the alms collected at the
  administration of the sacrament, and many of them use the money as a
  charm to cure the diseases of the body. A short time ago a woman came to
  a clergyman, and brought with her half-a-crown, asking at the same time
  for five "sacrament sixpences" in exchange. She said that one of her
  relations was ill, and that she wished to use the money as a charm to
  drive away the disease. This superstition may have arisen from the once
  prevalent custom of distributing the alms in the church to those of the
  poor who were present at the sacrament.</p>

  <p>I have heard that the negroes in Jamaica attach the same "gifts of
  healing" to the consecrated bread, and often, if they can escape notice,
  will carry it away with them. As no account of this superstition seems to
  be recorded in "N. &amp; Q.," perhaps you would like to "make a note of
  it."</p>

  <p><i>Propitiating the Fairies.</i>&mdash;Having some years since, on a
  Sunday afternoon, had occasion to ride on horseback between two towns in
  the eastern part of Cornwall, I met a christening party, also on
  horseback, headed by the nurse with a baby in her arms. Making a halt as
  I approached her, she stopped me, and producing a <i>cake</i>, presented
  it to me, and insisted on my taking it. Several years after, when in the
  Isle of Man, I had the opportunity of hearing an elderly person relate
  several pieces of folk lore respecting the witches and fairies in that
  island. It had been customary, within his recollection, for a woman, when
  carrying a child to be christened, to take with her <i>a piece of bread
  and cheese</i>, to give to the first person she met, for the purpose of
  <i>saving the child from witchcraft or the fairies</i>. Another custom
  was that of the "Queeltah," or salt put under the churn <i>to keep off
  bad people</i>. Stale water was thrown on the plough "to keep it from the
  <i>little <!-- Page 618 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page618"></a>{618}</span>folks</i>." A cross was tied in the tail
  of a cow "to keep her from <i>bad bodies</i>." On May morning it was
  deemed of the greatest importance to avoid going to a neighbour's house
  for fire; a turf was therefore kept burning all night at home. Flowers
  growing in a hedge, especially green or yellow ones, were good to keep
  off the fairies. And finally, the last cake was left "behind the
  turf-flag for the little people."</p>

  <p><i>Cornish Folk Lore: King Arthur in the Form of a Raven.</i>&mdash;In
  Jarvis's translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, book <span
  class="scac">II</span>. chap.&nbsp;v., the following passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Have you not read, sir,' answered Don Quixote, 'the annals and
  histories of England, wherein are recorded the famous exploits of King
  Arthur, whom in our Castilian tongue we always call King Artus; of whom
  there goes an old tradition, and a common one all over that kingdom of
  Great Britain, that this king did not die, but that by magic art he was
  turned into a raven; and that, in process of time, he shall reign again,
  and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot be
  proved, that, from that time to this, any Englishman has killed a
  raven?'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My reason for transcribing this passage is to record the curious fact
  that the legend of King Arthur's existence in the form of a raven was
  still repeated as a piece of folk lore in Cornwall about sixty years ago.
  My father, who died about two years since at the age of eighty, spent a
  few years of his youth in the neighbourhood of Penzance. One day, as he
  was walking along Marazion Green with his fowling-piece on his shoulder,
  he saw a raven at a distance and fired at it. An old man who was near
  immediately rebuked him, telling him that he ought on no account to have
  shot at a raven, for that King Arthur was still alive in the form of that
  bird. My father was much interested when I drew his attention to the
  passage which I have quoted above. Perhaps some of your Cornish or Welsh
  correspondents may be able to say whether the legend is still known among
  the people of Cornwall or Wales.</p>

  <p><i>St. Clement's Apple Feast in Staffordshire.</i>&mdash;On the feast
  of St. Clement's (Nov. 23) the children go round to the various houses in
  the villages to which they belong singing the following doggerel:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Clemany! Clemany! Clemany mine!</p>
      <p>A good red apple and a pint of wine,</p>
      <p>Some of your mutton and some of your veal,</p>
      <p>If it is good, pray give me a deal;</p>
      <p>If it is not, pray give some salt.</p>
      <p>Butler, butler, fill your bowl;</p>
      <p>If thou fillst it of the best,</p>
      <p>The Lord'll send your soul to rest;</p>
      <p>If thou fillst it of the small,</p>
      <p>Down goes butler, bowl and all.</p>
      <p>Pray, good mistress, send to me</p>
      <p>One for Peter, one for Paul,</p>
      <p>One for Him who made us all,</p>
      <p>Apple, pear, plum, or cherry,</p>
      <p>Any good thing to make us merry;</p>
      <p>A bouncing buck and a velvet chair,</p>
      <p>Clement comes but once a year;</p>
      <p>Off with the pot and on with the pan,</p>
      <p>A good red apple and I'll begone."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>How the above came to be conglomerated I know not, as there seem to be
  at least three separate compositions pressed into St. Clement's
  service.</p>

  <p>I shall be glad to know if any of your contributors can furnish
  farther illustrations of St. Clement's apple feast. I believe, in
  Worcestershire, St. Catherine and St. Clement unite in becoming the
  patrons on these occasions.</p>

  <p><i>New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.</i>&mdash;Another German custom
  prevalent in Philadelphia is the custom of celebrating the departure of
  the old year and the arrival of the new by discharges of fire-arms. As
  soon as the sun sets the firing commences, and it is kept up all night
  with every description of musket, fowling-piece, and pistol. It is called
  "firing out the old year" and "firing in the new year."</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Carlist Calembourg.</i>&mdash;The original of the French <i>jeu
  d'esprit</i> in Vol. viii., p. 242., was a Carlist calembourg circulated
  in the <i>salons</i> about the middle of 1831:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"La nation n'aime pas Louis-Philippe mais en rit (Henri)."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There was another also very popular:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In travelling to Bordeaux you must go to Orleans."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">V. T. Sternberg.</span></p>

  <p><i>Jewish Custom.</i>&mdash;In a recently published music-novel of
  some merit, called <i>Charles Auchester</i>, occurs the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'I shall treat him as my son, because he will indeed be my
  music-child, and no more indebted to me than I am to music, or than we
  all are to Jehovah.' <i>'Sir, you are certainly a Jew, if you say
  Jehovah</i>; I was quite sure of it before, and I am so pleased.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a great error as to custom here, for the Jews never attempt
  to pronounce the "four-lettered" Name, and in reading and speaking always
  use instead Adonai or Elohim. And even converted Jews retain for the most
  part the same habit. The writer of <i>Charles Auchester</i> can only
  defend himself by the example of the writer of <!-- Page 619 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page619"></a>{619}</span><i>Ivanhoe</i>, who has
  made the same oversight; and a still more glaring one besides in making
  Isaac the Jew wish his daughter had been called Benoni, <i>i.e.</i> the
  <i>son</i> of sorrow. The vowel letters of Jehovah are merely those of
  Adonai, inserted by the Massorites; but this is another subject.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Fraser</span>.</p>

  <p class="address">Tor-Mohun.</p>

  <p><i>Lachlan Macleane.</i>&mdash;This individual, whose claim to the
  authorship of Junius has been lately revived, was in Philadelphia
  ninety-five years ago, and his name figures there in the accounts of the
  overseers of the poor, under date of November 9, 1758:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"By cash received of James Coultass, late sheriff, being a fine paid
  by Laughlane M&lsquo;Clain for kissing of Osborn's wife (after his
  commissions and writing bond were deducted)</p>

  <p class="author">£24 : 5 : 0"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was in Pennsylvania currency; but it was an expensive kiss even
  in that, being (besides the commissions and sheriff's charge for writing
  the bond) equivalent to sixty-four dollars and fifty cents of our present
  currency.</p>

  <p class="author">M. E.</p>

  <p class="address">Philadelphia.</p>

  <p><i>German Tree.</i>&mdash;The following extract concerning this
  accessory to Christmas, which is now so popular, may perhaps be
  interesting at the present season. It is taken from the <i>Loseley
  Manuscripts</i>, edited by A.&nbsp;J. Kempe, F.S.A., 1836, p.&nbsp;75. note.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We remember a German of the household of the late Queen Caroline,
  making what he termed a <i>Christmas tree</i> for a juvenile party at
  that festive season. The tree was a branch of some evergreen fastened on
  a board. Its boughs bent under the weight of gilt oranges, almonds,
  &amp;c.; and under it was a neat model of a farm-house, surrounded by
  figures of animals, &amp;c., and all due accompaniments. The forming
  Christmas trees is, we believe, a common custom in Germany: evidently a
  remain of the pageants constructed at that season in ancient days."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is this the first notice of a German tree in England? The adjunct of
  the farm-house seems now to be dispensed with in this country.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Zeus.</span></p>

  <p><i>The late Duke.</i>&mdash;The following curious coincidence, which
  lately appeared in the <i>Meath Herald</i>, deserves transplanting to the
  literary museum of "N. &amp; Q.":</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From the fact of the Mornington family having been so connected by
  property, &amp;c. with the parish of Trim, in which town the late Duke
  spent so many of his early days, and commenced his career in life by
  being elected, when scarcely twenty-one years of age, to represent the
  old borough of Trim, the following coincidence is worth relating. On the
  news of the death of the Duke reaching Trim, the Very Rev. Dean Butler
  caused the chime of bells to be rung in respect to his memory; and the
  large bell, which was considered one of the finest and sweetest in
  Ireland, hardly had tolled a second time for the occasion when it
  suddenly broke, became mute, and ceased to send forth its notes. Whether
  this was to be attributed to neglect of the ringer, or regret for the
  great man of the age, it is hard to say; but, very odd as it may appear
  to be, on examining the bell, it was found to be cast by Edmund Blood,
  1769, the very year the Duke was born. Thus this fine bell commenced its
  career with the birth of the Duke, and ceased to sound at his death. The
  parish of Trim is now getting the bell recast, and the old metal is to be
  seen at Mr. Hodges, Abbey Street, Dublin."</p>

      <p>Who, like ourselves, have made the Boot and Shoe!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The story as told in these verses is not exactly the same as the one
  current among the makers of the boot and shoe in our own island, an
  account in an old book called <i>The History of the Gentle Craft</i> (the
  production, no doubt, of the well-known Thomas Delony) being the basis of
  the tradition as received now by the British shoemaker. In the <i>Golden
  Legende</i>, one of the earliest of our printed books, and in Alban
  Butler's <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, as compiled from the Roman
  Martyrologies, as also in the inscriptions of some pieces of ancient
  tapestry formerly belonging to the shoemakers' chapel in the Cathedral of
  Notre Dame, Paris, but, when I saw them, in one of the galleries of the
  Louvre, is the like version as the one here given. The authority, too, of
  the Church Calendar of England, even as it still remains after the
  loppings of the Reformation, is another corroboration that <span
  class="sc">Crispin</span> and <span class="sc">Crispianus</span>,
  brothers, were early martyrs to the Christian faith, and through that
  chiefly honoured, and not because the one became a redoubted general and
  the other a successful suitor to the daughter of some all-potent emperor.
  In the Delony version&mdash;itself, in every probability, a borrowing
  from the popular mind of the Elizabethan period,&mdash;these things are
  put forth; while in trade paintings and songs the Prince <span
  class="sc">Crispin</span> is assumed to have a wife or sister, one can
  hardly tell which, in the person of a princess, the Princess <span
  class="sc">Crispianus</span>, and who figures as the patron of the
  women's branch of the shoemakers' art; <span class="sc">Crispin</span>
  himself presiding over the coarser labour for the rougher sex. This
  artifice, if not purely historical, is at least very excusable, because
  so natural, seeing that the duplex principle has such an extensive range;
  that even the feet themselves come into the world in pairs, and so shoes
  must be produced after the same fashion&mdash;paired, as the shoemakers
  have done by their adored <span class="sc">Crispin</span> and <span
  class="sc">Crispianus</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Sewell Family</i> (Vol. viii., p. 521.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  D.&nbsp;N. states, that "nothing farther is known of the family of Lieut.-Col.
  Sewell, who died in 1803, than that he had a son Thos. Bailey Heath
  Sewell, Cornet in 32nd Light Dragoons, and Lieutenant 4th Dragoon
  Guards." Had he referred to Lodge's <i>Peerage</i>, he would have found
  that the Honorable Harriet Beresford, fourth daughter of the Most Rev.
  Wm. Beresford, Lord Archbishop of Tuam, and first Baron Decies, married
  Jan. 25, 1796, Thos. Henry Bermingham (not Bailey) Daly Sewell, Esq.; and
  died June 11, 1834, having had three children, viz.:</p>

  <p>1. Thomas, formerly Page of Honour to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
  <i>circa</i> 1829, afterwards a pensioner of Trin. Coll. Dublin, and
  subsequently Lieutenant 13th Light Infantry; who died at Landour, Bengal,
  Aug. 1, 1836.</p>

  <p>2. Isabella, who married her cousin Major Marcus Beresford, in
  October, 1828; and died in 1836.</p>

  <p>3. Louisa, married to the Hon. Sir W. E. Leeson, and died in 1849 or
  1850.</p>

  <p>Will D. N. favour me with the dates of the birth and death of the late
  unfortunate, and, as I believe, ill-used Lieut.-General John Whitelocke,
  whom he mentions, with the localities where the birth and death
  occurred?</p>

  <p class="author">G. L. S.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We have submitted our correspondent's communication to D.&nbsp;N., who has
  kindly forwarded the following reply:</p>

  <p>"My communication (Vol. viii., p. 521.) I was aware was far from a
  perfect pedigree of the Sewell family, and my object was to give such
  notices as might form an outline to be filled up by some one more
  competently informed. Your correspondent G.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S. has very well supplied
  the <i>cætera desunt</i>, where my information terminated with the
  appointment of Cornet Sewell to a Lieutenancy in the 4th (Royal Irish)
  Dragoon Guards. In the London Gazette 13789, June 23, 1795, he is
  inserted as 'Mr. Bermingham Daly Henry Sewell' to be a cornet in the 32nd
  Light Dragoons; and as in filling up commissions much accuracy is always
  considered very essential, I am disposed to regard those Christian names
  as correct.</p>

  <p>"There was a Rev. George Sewell, Rector of Byfleet, Surrey, Was he a
  brother of Lieut.-Col. Sewell of the Surrey Light Dragoons?</p>

  <p>"Did the Right Hon. Sir Thomas Sewell marry a second wife? For I find,
  in <i>The Globe</i> of October 9, 1820: 'Died, Saturday, Sept. 16, at
  Twyford Lodge, Maresfield, Sussex, in her seventy-eighth year, Lady
  Sewell, widow of the late Right Hon. Sir Thomas Sewell, Master of the
  Rolls and Privy Councillor, &amp;c.' Now, in Manning's <i>Surrey</i>,
  vol.&nbsp;iii. p.&nbsp;201., it is stated that Lieut.-Col. Sewell died in 1803, in
  his fifty-eighth year, which would render it impossible for him to be the
  son of the above-named Lady Sewell. In Horsfield's <i>Sussex</i>, 4to.,
  1835, vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;375., I find a William Luther Sewell, Esq., who most
  probably was connected by the second marriage, residing at the above
  Twyford Lodge.</p>

  <p>"I regret that I cannot reply distinctly to the inquiries of G.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S.
  respecting the late Lieut.-General Whitelocke. I have ineffectually
  searched all the various biographical dictionaries to that of the Rev.
  H.&nbsp;J. Rose in twelve volumes, 1848, inclusive, without having found one
  that has taken the least notice of him. I had casually heard, some years
  since, that he had fixed his residence in Somersetshire, and that he had
  died there; which I find confirmed by a paragraph in the <i>Annual
  Register</i>, vol. lxxvi. for 1834 (<i>Chronicle</i>), p. 218., which
  states that he died 'near Bath,' in February, 1834. With such scanty
  information on the required points, I would still refer G.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S. to a
  work entitled <i>The Georgian Æra</i>, in 4 vols., London, 1832; where he
  will find, in vol. ii. p 475., a short <i>military</i> memoir of
  Lieut.-General Whitelocke, which is dispassionately and candidly written,
  and which accounts very reasonably for the inauspicious result of his
  military operations. There is one slight error in the account of <i>The
  Georgian Æra</i>, viz. in the date of the <!-- Page 622 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page622"></a>{622}</span><i>first</i>
  appointment of Mr. Whitelocke to a commission in the army, which appears
  in the <i>London Gazette</i>, No. 11938. of December 26, 1778, and runs
  thus: '14th Foot, John Whitelocke, Gent., to be Ensign <i>vice</i>
  Day."&mdash;I trust some reader of "N. &amp; Q." will furnish us with the
  dates of the birth and death of Lieut.-General Whitelocke, specifying
  when they took place, as desired by G.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;S., with an abridgment of
  deficient particulars in his history.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D. N."]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Greek Epigram.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Bath Chronicle</i> of the 10th
  of November last, I find the following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Clergyman of a Town Parish, in which are several crippled
  persons, at present unable to attend divine worship, will feel very
  grateful to any gentleman or lady who will give him an old Bath chair for
  the use of these poor people; two blind men having offered, in this case,
  charitably to convey their crippled neighbours regularly to the house of
  God."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Surely this arrangement is not a new idea, and there is, if I mistake
  not, a Greek epigram that records its success in practice several hundred
  years ago. Can any of your readers, whose Greek is less faded than mine,
  refer me to the epigram?</p>

  <p>An inscription on a tomb at Besford, near Pershore, Worcestershire, of
  the same period as that at Aylesbury (mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Brooks</span>), contains also the word <i>imp</i>. The tomb at Besford is
  a most singular one, consisting of two large folding doors fixed against
  the wall, their panels and the interior being painted over with figures
  and inscriptions. From the latter, which are of some length, the
  following extracts will be sufficient to illustrate the subject:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"An <i>impe</i> entombed heere doth lie."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The old poetical word <i>sugared</i>, "Noe sugred word," occurs in the
  inscription.</p>

  <p>The "impe" is supposed to be Richard Harewell, who died in 1576, aged
  15 years, to whom a second monument, of alabaster (close by the former),
  was also erected; a rare circumstance, I should suppose. The Harewells
  appear to have been a family at the time of the Conquest; the two
  following lines are a part of one of the inscriptions:</p>

  <div class="poem">

<h3>THE DIVINING ROD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 293. 479.)</p>

  <p>The inclosed extract from a letter which I have just received from a
  friend on the subject of the divining rod, will probably interest your
  readers as an answer to a Query which appeared some weeks ago in your
  excellent work. You may entirely rely on the accuracy of the facts
  stated.</p>

  <p class="author">J. A. H.</p>

  <p>"However the pretended effect of the divining rod may be attributed to
  knavery and credulity by philosophers who will not take the trouble of
  witnessing and investigating the operation, any one who will pay a visit
  to the Mendip Hills in Somersetshire, and the country round their base,
  may have abundant proof of the efficacy of it. Its success has been very
  strikingly proved along the range of the Pennard Hills also, to the South
  of the Mendip. The faculty of discovering water by means of the divining
  rod is not possessed by every one; for indeed there are but few who
  possess it in any considerable degree, or in whose hands the motion of
  the rod, when passing over an underground stream, is very decided; and
  they who have it are quite unconscious of their capability until they are
  made aware of it by experiment.</p>

  <p>"I saw the operation of the rod, or rather of a fork, formed of the
  shoots of the last year, held in the hands of the experimentor by the
  extremities, with the angle projecting before him. When he came over the
  spot beneath which the water flowed, the rod, which had before been
  perfectly still, writhed about with considerable force, so that the
  holder could not keep it in its former position; and he appealed to the
  bystanders to notice that he had made no motion to produce this effect,
  and used every effort to prevent it. The operation was several times
  repeated with the same result, and each time under the close inspection
  of shrewd and doubting, if not incredulous, observers. Forks of any kind
  of green wood served equally well, but those of dead wood had no effect.
  The experimentor had discovered water, in several instances, in the same
  parish (Pennard), but was perfectly unaware of his capability till he was
  requested by his landlord to try. The operator had the reputation of a
  perfectly honest man, whose word might be safely <!-- Page 624 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page624"></a>{624}</span>trusted, and who was
  incapable of attempting to deceive any one&mdash;as indeed appeared by
  his open and ingenuous manner and conversation on this occasion. He was a
  farmer, and respected by all his neighbours. So general is the conviction
  of the efficacy of the divining rod in discovering both water and the
  ores of calamine or zinc all over the Mendip, that the people are quite
  astonished when any doubt is expressed about it. The late Dr. Hutton
  wrote against the pretension, as one of many instances of deception
  founded upon gross ignorance and credulity; when a lady of quality, who
  herself possessed the faculty, called upon him, and gave him experimental
  proof, in the neighbourhood of Woolwich, that water was discoverable by
  that means. This Dr. Hutton afterwards publicly acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"The above I suppose will suffice for your present purpose; I could,
  however, say a great deal more, for I wrote a very long account many
  years ago to our friend &mdash;&mdash;, of what I have now only briefly
  stated. That letter was treated by certain scientific friends of his with
  contempt; but when I afterwards saw poor Dr. Turner, he said he would go
  down to Somerset to see it himself; but alas! he did not live to carry
  his intention into effect."</p>

<h3>CHANGE OF MEANING IN PROVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS,
ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 464, 465.)</p>

  <p>Very hesitatingly I venture to express dissent from <span
  class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> ingenious suggestion of a change of
  meaning in the proverb "Tread on a worm and it will turn." I support my
  dissent, however, by the following lines from Shakspeare:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?</p>
      <p>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</p>
      <p>The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on;</p>
      <p>And doves will peck in safe-guard of their brood."</p>
      <p class="i2">Third Part of <i>King Henry VI.</i>, Act II. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>King Henry says, Withhold revenge, dear God!</p>

  <p>Clifford replies, The lion, the bear, the serpent, the smallest worm,
  and doves, if injured, will make an effort at revenge or defence. It is
  clear that Shakspeare uses the word <i>worm</i> as meaning, not a
  venomous serpent, but the most defenceless of reptiles.</p>

  <p>Again, I do not think that <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span>
  quotation from Schiller's <i>Wallenstein's Tod</i> supports his view. I
  am not a German scholar, but I find that the translator of
  <i>Wallenstein's Tod</i> (I believe Lord Ellesmere) has translated or
  paraphrased the lines quoted by <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But nature gave the very worm a sting,</p>
      <p>When trampled on by man, to turn again."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The sense of the passage (spoken by Butler) requires that "wurm"
  should be understood to mean a harmless despised reptile, not a venomous
  serpent.</p>

  <p>It seems that Schiller had Shakspeare in his mind when he wrote the
  lines in question; indeed, they are almost a copy of Shakspeare's line. I
  consider them as parallel passages.</p>

  <p>It may not be irrelevant to observe that <i>worm</i> in some places
  still means a serpent; but I believe it has usually a prefix, as
  "hag-worm" in Westmoreland and the West Riding of Yorkshire; so also in
  the latter "slow-worm" means a species of small snake or viper found on
  some of the moors. (For "slow-worm," see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., pp.
  33. and 479.) I have been told that "blind-worm" in Surrey means a viper.
  I conclude with a Query, Does <i>Wurm</i> in modern German ever mean a
  serpent?</p>

  <p class="author">F. W. J.</p>

  <p>"To put a spoke in one's wheel," is not singular in its <i>double
  entendre</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 262. 351. 464.). "There is no love lost
  between them" is in a similar predicament. We now speak of no love being
  lost between A. and B., when we would intimate that the warmth of their
  mutual affection may be accurately represented by 32° Fahrenheit. That
  this has not always been the meaning of the phrase, the following verse
  from the old ballad of <i>The Children in the Wood</i> will testify:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sore sick he was, and like to die,</p>
      <p class="i1">No help that he could have;</p>
      <p>His wife by him as sick did lie,</p>
      <p class="i1">And both possess'd one grave.</p>
      <p><i>No love between these two was lost</i>,</p>
      <p class="i1">Each was to other kind;</p>
      <p>In love they lived, in love they died,</p>
      <p class="i1">And left two babes behind."</p>

<h3>SNEEZING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 366.)</p>

  <p>A collection of "facts, theories, and popular ideas" upon this subject
  would fill a volume. I send, however, a few extracts, &amp;c., which may
  interest your correspondent <span class="sc">Medicus</span>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Et n'esternuay point regardant le soleil."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And did not sneeze as he looked upon the sun."</p>
      <p class="i1">Ronsard, tom. v. p. 158., quoted in Southey's</p>
      <p class="i2"><i>Common Place Book</i>, 3rd series, p. 303.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here, not to sneeze appears to be looked on as an ill omen.</p>

  <p>Ammianus has an epigram upon one whose nose was so long that he never
  heard it sneeze, and therefore never said <span title="Zeu sôson" class="grk"
  >&Zeta;&epsilon;&#x1FE6; &sigma;&#x1FF6;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;</span>, God

  Bat.), p. 720. <!-- Page 625 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page625"></a>{625}</span></p>

  <p>Athenæus, says Potter in his <i>Archæologia Græca</i>, proves that the
  head was esteemed holy, because it was customary to swear by it, and
  adore as holy the sneezes that proceeded from it. And Aristotle tells us
  in express terms that sneezing was accounted a deity: "<span title="Ton Ptarmon theon hêgoumetha" class="grk"
  >&Tau;&#x1F78;&nu; &Pi;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&#x1F78;&nu;

      <p class="i2"><i>Noct. Att.</i> <span class="scac">III</span>. xvi. 24.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Erasmus, in his <i>Colloquies</i>, bids one say to him who sneezes,
  "Sit faustum ac felix," or "Servet te Deus," or "Sit salutiferum" or
  "Bene vertat Deus."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quare homines sternutant?</p>

  <p>"Respondetur, ut virtus expulsiva et visiva, per hoc purgetur, et
  cerebrum a sua superfluitate purgetur, etc. Etiam qui sternutat
  frequenter, dicitur habere forte cerebrum."&mdash;<i>Aristotelis
  Problemata</i>: Amstelodami, anno 1690.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query whether from some such idea of the beneficial effect of
  sneezing, arose the practice of calling for the divine blessing on the
  sneezer?</p>

  <p>When Themistocles was offering sacrifice, it happened that three
  beautiful captives were brought him, and at the same time the fire burnt
  clear and bright, and a sneeze happened on the right hand. Hereupon
  Euphrantides the soothsayer, embracing him, predicted the memorable
  victory which was afterwards obtained by him, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>There is also mention of this custom (the observation of sneezing) in
  Homer, who has introduced Penelope rejoicing at a sneeze of her son
  Telemachus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="Ouch horaas ho moi huios epeptaren" class="grk"

  &#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F73;&pi;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&nu;</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sneezing was not always a lucky omen, but varied according to the
  alteration of circumstances&mdash;"<span title="Tôn ptarmôn hoi men eisin ôphelimoi, hoi de blaberoi" class="grk"
  >&Tau;&#x1FF6;&nu; &pi;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&#x1FF6;&nu;

  &beta;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span>," "Some
  sneezes are profitable, others prejudicial"&mdash;according to the
  scholiast upon the following passage of Theocritus, wherein he makes the
  sneezing of the Cupids to have been an unfortunate omen to a certain
  lover:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="Simichida men erôtes epeptaron." class="grk"

</blockquote>

  <p>If any person sneezed between midnight and the following noontide it
  was fortunate, but from noontide till midnight it was unfortunate.</p>

  <p>If a man sneezed at the table while they were taking away, or if
  another happened to sneeze upon his left hand, it was unlucky; if on the
  right hand, fortunate.</p>

  <p>If, in the undertaking any business, two or four sneezes happened, it
  was a lucky omen, and gave encouragement to proceed; if more than four,
  the omen was neither good nor bad; if one or three, it was unlucky, and
  dehorted them from proceeding in what they had designed. If two men were
  deliberating about any business, and both of them chanced to sneeze
  together, it was a prosperous omen.&mdash;<i>Archæol. Græc.</i> (5th

  <p>The custom your correspondent <span class="sc">Medicus</span> alludes
  to, of wishing a person "good health," after sneezing, is also very

<h3>BOOKS BURNED BY THE COMMON HANGMAN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 272. 346.)</p>

  <p>To the list of these literary <i>auto da fé's</i> we may well add the
  burning of Bishop Burnet's famous <i>Pastoral Letter</i>, which was
  censured by the House of Commons, January, 1692, and was burned by the
  common hangman. The offence contained in it was the ascribing the title
  of William III. to the crown of England to a right of conquest. A
  recollection of this gives additional point to the irony of Atterbury in
  attacking Wake:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"William the Conqueror is another of the pious patterns he recommends,
  'who would suffer nothing,' he says, 'to be determined in any
  ecclesiastical causes without leave and authority first had from him.'...
  His present majesty is not William the Conqueror; and can no more by our
  constitution rule absolutely either in Church or State than he would if
  he could: his will and pleasure is indeed a law to all his subjects; not
  in a conquering sense, but because his will and pleasure is only that the
  laws of our country should be obeyed, which he came over on purpose to
  rescue, and counts it his great prerogative to maintain; and contemns
  therefore, I doubt not, such sordid flattery as would measure the extent
  of his supremacy from the Conqueror's claim."&mdash;Atterbury's
  <i>Rights, Powers, and Privileges of Convocation</i>, pp.
  158&mdash;160.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Atterbury never misses a hit at Burnet when he can conveniently
  administer one, and the Bishop endeavours to smile even while he
  winces:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He writes with just and due respect of the king and the present
  constitution. This has come so seldom from that corner that it ought to
  be the more considered. I will not give that scope to jealousy as to
  suspect that this was an artifice; but accept it sincerely,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;The Bishop of Sarum's <i>Reflections on the Rights, Powers,
  &amp;c.</i>. p. 4.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Fraser.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Tor-Mohun.</p>

  <p>The following, may come under the list wanted by <span
  class="sc">Balliolensis</span>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The covenant itself, together with the act for erecting the high
  court of justice, that for subscribing the engagement, and that for
  declaring England a <!-- Page 626 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the hands of the hangman. The people assisted with great alacrity on this
  occasion."&mdash;From Hume, Reign of Charles II., edit. London, 1828, p.
  762.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On a copy of <i>La Défense de la Réformation, &amp;c</i>., par I.
  Claude, à La Haye, 1683, I noted the following about thirty years ago as
  a striking passage, but cannot now recollect from whence I took it. This
  book was condemned by the Pope to be burned, on which circumstance the
  editor of an old edition of it very appositely observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Books have souls as well as men, which survive their martyrdom, and
  are not burnt, but crowned by the flames that encircle them. The Church
  of Rome has quickly felt there was nothing combustible but the paper. The
  truth flew upward like the angel from Manoah's sacrifice, untouched by
  the fire, and unsullied by the smoke, and found a safe refuge at the
  footstool of the God of Truth."</p>

<h3>JEWS IN CHINA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 515.)</p>

  <p>The only people known as descendants of any of the ten tribes are the
  Spomerim, or Samaritans; whose chief peculiarity is, that they
  acknowledge as sacred only the five books of Moses: for, although other
  books held sacred by the Jews are known to them, such books are not
  written in the same ancient alphabetic character as those of the
  Samaritan Pentateuch. The ten tribes were then taken captive <span
  class="scac">B.C</span>. 721 (2 Kings xvii. 24&mdash;41.). The inference
  is, therefore, that all the books, from Joshua to Malachi inclusive, had
  not been composed or admitted into the holy canon till after that date.
  The criterion then for ascertaining whether the Chinese Jews are
  descended from the ten tribes, appears to be their adherence to the
  Pentateuch <i>alone</i> as sacred. I. The Chinese Jews have not the
  ancient Hebrew character, but the comparatively modern square Chaldee
  one, as in our printed Bibles. II. Gozani states that the Jews of Kaafung
  Foo, in Honan, had some traditions from the Talmud. The Mishnah,
  constituting the text of the Talmud, is manifestly a compilation
  <i>subsequent</i> to the closing of the Jewish canon; the quotations from
  the books following those of Moses being constantly in use therein. III.
  On Gozani mentioning Jesus the Messiah, the Chinese Jew said they had a
  knowledge of Jesus the son of Sirach. As, however, the book of the
  last-named writer is unknown in Hebrew, Gozani, who was ignorant of that
  language, may have mistaken him for Jesus (=Joshua) the son of Nun, with
  which book the Chinese Jew was acquainted.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> In either case, <i>more</i> books
  than the Pentateuch were undoubtedly held sacred by these Chinese Jews;
  therefore the connexion with the ten tribes (house of Israel), as
  distinct from the house of Judah (the Jews properly so called), cannot be
  inferred. The authorities for the Samaritans are Scaliger, Ludolf,
  Prideaux, Jahn, Huntington, Winer, Schnurrer, and Kitto. For the eastern
  Jews: Josephus, Peritsol, Manasseh, Basnage, Büsching; Fathers Ricci,
  Aleni, Gozani, and other Jesuits, in the <i>Lettres édifiantes et
  curieuses</i>, vol. xviii.; and the <i>Chinese Repository</i>, vol.&nbsp;i.
  pp. 8. 44., vol. iii. p. 175.</p>

  <p>Circumcision is too general a practice in the hotter regions of the
  south and east, to permit such practice to be deemed proof of Jewish
  descent, unless corroborated by other customs peculiar to the Jews.
  Besides the physiological characteristics of the native Australians
  preclude us from deducing their natural descent from either the
  <i>Jews</i> or the ten tribes.</p>

  <p>The opprobrious name of Christ amongst the Jews is Jesus son of Sadta,
  which Gozani may have mistaken for Sirach; indeed,&mdash;the Chinese
  pronunciation of Hebrew is quite peculiar, as they cannot pronounce, for
  instance, the letters <i>b</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>th</i>, naming them
  respectively <i>p</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>z</i>.</p>

<h3>POETICAL TAVERN SIGNS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 242. 452.)</p>

  <p>I made a note of the following specimen of poetical tavern sign, in

<h3>THE CURFEW.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>(Vol. ii., pp. 103. 175. 189. 311.; Vol. iv., p. 240.; Vol. vi., pp.
  53. 112.; Vol. vii., pp. 167. 530.; Vol. viii., p. 603.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The curfew is still rung at Kidderminster at eight o'clock. It is the
  annual custom there, on a certain night, to continue the ringing for one
  hour, a sum of money having been left for that purpose as a
  thank-offering to God, for the curfew having been the means of saving a
  person from destruction. This person had lost his way on his return from
  Bridgenorth Fair, and when (as he afterwards discovered) on the point of
  falling from a great height, the sound of the Kidderminster curfew caused
  him to retrace his steps and regain the road. A five o'clock morning bell
  is also rung at Kidderminster. This and the curfew bell have been rung
  for many years past by "Blind William," who, notwithstanding his total
  blindness, finds his way along the streets that lead from his house to
  the church, and gains the belfry with the greatest ease. So well is he
  acquainted with the path to church, that he may be seen to turn the
  corners of the streets in as decided a manner as if his wide-open eyes
  were endowed with sight; and, with similar facility, he unlocks the gates
  and church doors. It is curious to see him on the dark winter evenings,
  apparently guiding his steps by the light of a lanthorn, which he
  probably carries in order to prevent careless people, who are blessed
  with sight, from running against him. Like most (if not all) blind
  people, he has an extraordinary ear for music, and will quickly reproduce
  on his violin any tune that may have caught his fancy. At this present
  festive period, a Kidderminster Christmas would lack one of its component
  parts, were Blind Willie and his fiddle not there to add to the harmony
  of the kindly season. During the month preceding Christmas, he promenades
  the streets at untimely hours, and draws from his old fiddle all the
  music which it is capable of giving forth. Indeed, Blind Willie may be
  considered (in Kidderminster at least) as the harbinger of Christmas, for
  he warns the inhabitants of its approach, long before the ordinary
  "waits" have taken their ordinary measures for the same purpose. And when
  Christmas Day is past and gone, he makes house-to-house visitation for
  the Christmas-box which is to be the reward of his "early
  minstrelsy."</p>

  <p>The curfew is rung at Bewdley in Worcestershire.</p>

  <p>At Durham the curfew is rung (on the great bell of the cathedral) at
  nine o'clock. It is therefore of the same use to the students of the
  University of Durham as "Tom" is to the students of the University of
  Oxford, viz. it marks the closing of the college gates.</p>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

  <p><i>Photographic Engraving.</i>&mdash;I inclose a copy of a little book
  for your inspection, which is remarkable only in this, that the
  illustrations are produced by photography. The general theory of the
  method is this: a piece of glass is covered with a uniform thin coating
  of some substance, so as to be opaque or semi-opaque (the substance
  should be light coloured), and a design is etched on it with a needle.
  From this <i>negative</i> positive pictures are printed
  photographically.</p>

  <p>As to details, the prints of the mice (p.&nbsp;46.) and the cat (p.&nbsp;37.)
  are from a glass coated with iodized collodion rendered sensitive,
  exposed to faint light for a short time and developed. In this method,
  the glass should be heated; and the collodion <i>burnished</i> with the
  hand, to make it adhere well.<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The owl (p.&nbsp;22.) and the stork
  (p.&nbsp;10.) are from a glass coated with iodized collodion "rendered
  sensitive" only, and not developed so as to be only semi-opaque. On this
  high lights were put with opaque white, and darks were etched out. This
  has the effect of a tinted lithograph, but requires much more care in
  printing than the former method, in order to hit the right tint; so much
  so, that I have usually printed the stork faintly so as not to show the
  "tint" at all. The frontispiece is from a paper negative, a method much
  more troublesome and tedious than either of the others, both in
  preparation of the negative and in printing.</p>

  <p>I have lately tried gilt glass to etch upon. This would be excellent,
  were it not most painful to the eyes. And more than two years ago, I
  prepared a negative by painting whites with water colour on transparent
  glass with moderate success.</p>

  <p>I have recently received from Rome a positive printed from a negative
  on smoked glass, the subject being a mule's head. Of all the methods I
  have tried, the best is the first mentioned; and it seems to me easier
  than any species of engraving.</p>

  <p>Query, What is the best coating for the glass; and what will be the
  cost of printing on a great scale, as compared with woodcut, lithograph,
  &amp;c.; in which must be included the cost of the skilled workman which
  will be saved by this method?</p>

  <p>This method was suggested to me by Professor Maconochie, who indeed
  prepared the glass on which the mice were etched.</p>

</div>
  <p><i>Collodion Negatives.</i>&mdash;Allow me to communicate a sure and
  simple way of darkening collodion positives for printing. It was shown to
  me by a friend of mine; and not having seen it in your "N. &amp; Q.," I
  have undertaken to lay it before your readers, hoping that it may be
  found useful to many beginners.</p>

  <p>After having developed your picture, as a positive, with protosulphate
  of iron and nitric acid, wash it well from the developing fluid, and keep
  it on one end that all the water may drop from the plate. Then take three
  parts of a concentrated solution of gallic acid, and one part of a
  nitrate of silver solution, 60 grains to the ounce of water; mix
  together, and pour on the plate. The picture will gradually begin to
  blacken; and after half an hour or more, you will obtain a sufficient
  density for printing a positive on paper.</p>

  <p>Every one who will take the trouble to try it will be sure to succeed.
  Of all the ways to blackening a picture for printing I have tried, not
  excepting Professor Maconochie's method with chloride of gold and muriate
  of ammonia, the surest I find is the one which I have laid before you.
  Just try it, and you will be glad with the result.</p>

  commencing upon "Those that will not work," Mr. Mayhew began with a
  history of prostitution in ancient and modern times, a subject which did
  not possess the novelty or originality of his other divisions, and
  consequently his readers fell off so fast that he was forced first to
  raise the price of, and afterwards to discontinue altogether, the
  publication. Probably, if he had confined himself to treating the London

  <p>Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Mary

  Greystock Castle, who married Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of
  George Tattersall, of West Court, Finchampstead, and Stapleford, co.
  Wilts.</p>

  <p>Charles Howard, as above, was the fourth brother of Henry, sixth Duke
  of Norfolk, which last was grandfather (through Thomas, his son, of

  Forfar, in Scotland.</p>

  <p><i>Grammar in relation to Logic</i> (Vol. viii., p. 514).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> evidently has but a superficial view of
  this doctrine, which is not only Dr. Latham's, but one, I apprehend,
  pretty well known to every Oxford undergraduate, viz. that, logically,
  <i>conjunctions connect propositions, not words</i>. By way of proving
  the falsity of it (which he says is demonstrable), he bids Dr. Latham
  "resolve this sentence: <i>All men are either two-legged, one-legged, or
  no-legged</i>:" and adds, "It cannot be done." I may inform him that the
  three categorical propositions, "A man is two-legged, or he is <!-- Page
  630 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page630"></a>{630}</span>one-legged, or he is no-legged," connected
  by their several copulas, are equivalent to and co-extensive with the
  disjunctive proposition which he instances.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> quotes Boole's <i>Mathematical (?)
  Analysis of Logic</i> in support of his opinion; but, from the following
  specimen of that work, it does not appear to be much of an authority. The
  author says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The proposition, Every animal is either rational or irrational,
  cannot be resolved into, Either every animal is rational or every animal
  is irrational. The former belongs to pure categoricals, the latter to
  hypotheticals."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now the first sentence of this passage is an absurd truism; but the
  proposition in question can be resolved into&mdash;An animal is rational
  or it is irrational. Again, "the former does <i>not</i> belong to pure
  categoricals," it is simply disjunctive. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ingleby</span> falls into the same error, and moreover seems not to be
  aware that a disjunctive proposition is at the same time
  hypothetical.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, a conjunction implies two propositions; and,
  strictly, connects propositions only. To say that conjunctions connect
  words, may be true in a certain sense; but it is a very superficial and
  loose mode of stating the matter.</p>

  fame before he made his descent on England, and his conclusion was that
  that Conqueror was remarkably well instructed for his time in the art of
  war. He expressed his intention to write on this subject; but great

  <p><i>Passage in Sophocles</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 73. 478.).&mdash;The
  Italics were introduced to draw attention to the <i>new</i> version which
  was adventured, "N. &amp; Q." being an excellent medium for such
  suggestions.</p>

  <p>Sophocles having referred to "an illustrious saying of some one," and
  the old scholiast having furnished this saying,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span title="Hotan d' ho daimôn andri porsunêi kaka" class="grk">&#x1F4D;&tau;&alpha;&nu; &delta;' &#x1F41; &delta;&alpha;&#x1F77;&mu;&omega;&nu; &#x1F00;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#x1F76; &pi;&omicron;&rho;&sigma;&#x1F7B;&nu;&#x1FC3; &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F70;</span></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>it merely became necessary to compare the form which Sophocles adopted
  to suit his metre with the words of this "illustrious saying," whence it
  appeared that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span title="hôi bouleuetai  prassei d' oligoston chronon ektos atas" class="grk">&#x1FA7; &beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota; = &pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &delta;' &#x1F40;&lambda;&iota;&gamma;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F78;&nu; &chi;&rho;&#x1F79;&nu;&omicron;&nu; &#x1F10;&kappa;&tau;&#x1F78;&sigmaf; &#x1F04;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and therefore I could not agree with the common version "and that he
  lives for a brief space apart from its visitation;" erroneous, as I
  submit, from the adoption of Brunck's reading <span title="prassein" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, instead of
  reading, as I venture to do, with Hermann, <span title="theos agei ... prassei d'" class="grk"
  >&theta;&epsilon;&#x1F78;&sigmaf; &#x1F04;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota; ...
  &pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &delta;'</span>, taking
  <span title="theos" class="grk">&theta;&epsilon;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>
  as the nominative of both verbs.</p>

  <p>Neither the Oxford translation, Edwards's, nor Buckley's, renders
  <span title="oligoston" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&lambda;&iota;&gamma;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>
  "<i>very</i> brief," agreeably to the admonition of the old scholiast to
  the contrary. The word "practise" objected to is, I submit, derived from
  <span title="prassô" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&omega;</span>, to act, through <span
  title="pragma" class="grk">&pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&gamma;&mu;&alpha;</span>,
  business, and <span title="praxis" class="grk"
  >&pi;&rho;&#x1FB6;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, practice, and is therefore
  the most appropriate English word, although the word "does" will furnish
  Sophocles' meaning nearly as well. I shall, however, be most happy to
  submit to correction by any classical scholar.</p>

  <p><i>Party-Similes of the Seventeenth Century</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  485.).&mdash;I must beg of you to contradict the loose statement of <span
  class="sc">Jarltzberg</span> at p. 486. of this Volume, "as to the object
  of the Church of England in <i>separating from</i> Rome." Now, the Church
  of England did never <i>separate herself</i> from <i>any</i> Christian
  Church; the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England is to be
  found in her Book of Common Prayer. Popes Paul IV. and Pius IV. offered
  to confirm this book, if Queen Elizabeth would acknowledge the Pope's
  supremacy; and Roman Catholics in these realms habitually conformed to
  the worship of the Church of England for the first <i>twelve years</i> of
  Queen Elizabeth's reign, after which time they were prevented from doing
  so by the bull of Pius V. (dated Feb. 23, 1569), which excommunicated
  that sovereign.</p>

  <p>So Romanists are the separatists, and not Anglicans.</p>

  <p><i>Judges styled Reverend</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 158. 276.
  351.).&mdash;Sir Anthony Fitzherbert was certainly not chief justice, yet
  in <i>A Letter to a Convocation Man</i> I find him so styled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I must admit that it is said in the second part of Rolle's
  <i>Abridgment</i>, that the Archbishop of Canterbury <!-- Page 632
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page632"></a>{632}</span>was prohibited
  to hold such assemblies by Fitzherbert, Chief Justice, because he had not
  the King's licence; but he adds that the archbishop would not obey it,
  and he quotes Speed for it. I shall not consult that lame historian for a
  law-point, and it seems strange that Rolle should cite
  him."&mdash;<i>L.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;M.</i>, p. 38.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not lately had an opportunity of looking into either Rolle's
  <i>Abridgment of Cases</i>, or Speed's <i>History of Great Britain</i>,
  but I am not able to discover to what event in any of Henry VIII.'s
  convocations allusion is here made. I am therefore led to think that
  Fitzherbert must be a misprint, and that we should read in the above
  passage "Fitz-Peter," and that the following is the circumstance, in King
  John's reign, which is referred to by the author of the
  <i>Letter</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This year (1200), Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, held a National
  Synod at Westminster, notwithstanding the prohibition of Geoffrey
  Fitz-Peter, Earl of Essex, and Chief Justiciary of
  England."&mdash;Collier's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, vol. i. folio,
  p. 410.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I shall be glad if any of your readers can throw farther light on the
  passage.</p>

  <p><i>Veneration for the Oak</i> (Vol. viii., p. 468.).&mdash;Since my
  Query upon this matter appeared, I find that Mr. Layard, in his work upon
  <i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>, at p. 160., describes a cylinder of green
  felspar, which he believes to have been the signet of Sennacherib, and
  upon which is engraved a rare mode of portraying the supreme deity, and a
  sacred tree, whose flowers are in this instance in the shape of an
  <i>acorn</i>. Whence did the Assyrians derive this veneration for a tree
  bearing acorns? Did they derive this notion, as they did their tin, from
  Celtic Britain? I believe they did.</p>

  <p><i>Rapping no Novelty</i> (Vol. viii., p. 512.).&mdash;De Foe, in his
  veracious <i>History of Mr. Duncan Campbell</i> (2nd ed., p. 107.),
  quotes a story of sprit-knocking from "the renowned and famous" Mr.
  Baxter's <i>History of Apparitions</i>, prefacing it thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What in nature can be more trivial than for a spirit to employ
  himself in knocking on a morning at the wainscot by the bed's head of a
  man who got drunk over night, according to the way that such things are
  ordinarily explained? And yet I shall give you such a relation of this,
  that not even the most devout and precise Presbyterian will offer to call
  in question."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>According to De Foe, Mr. Baxter gave full credit to the story, adding
  many pious reflections upon the subject, and expressing himself "posed to
  think what kind of spirit this is."</p>
